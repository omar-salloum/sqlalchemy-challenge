# sqlalchemy-challenge
Module 10 Challenge

# Description
This project consisted of two main components:
1) querying and analyzing a climate database
2) designing a Flask API to present the results.

# Data querying and analysis
- I utilized SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib to conduct basic climate analysis and data exploration on the climate database, extracting insights through precipitation and station analyses.

# Flask API
- I designed a Flask API to provide a user-friendly interface for accessing the analysis results. The API offers endpoints such as retrieving precipitation data for the last 12 months, listing stations, and obtaining temperature observations for different filters.
